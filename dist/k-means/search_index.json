Clustering is the task of automatically grouping data into coherent clusters based on their feature space. Clustering methods, including k-means have many applications, including market segmentation, social network analysis, organizing computer clusters, and astronomical data analysis.\n\n    \n\n\nK-means is an iteratively trained batch algorithm, and the core idea behind it is intuitive. K-means only takes one hyper-parameter, K, which is the number of clusters. The algorithm partitions all data points into K non-overlapping clusters. This is accomplished by iteratively moving, according to a specific set of steps, a set of points called ‘centroids’ around in feature space. Each datapoint in the set is assigned to its closest centroid. A set of points with a common closest centroid is called a cluster. We use the name ‘K-means’ for two reasons, because the centroids are also called, somewhat incorrectly, ‘means,’ and because by convention the number of centroids is K. This algorithm works on the intuition that a set of points belonging to the same class should be closer together in features space.\nAlthough it is a very efficient algorithm, K-means does have some inherent weaknesses. Most famous among them is that there is no general solution to find the optimal number of clusters for any given data set. We will provide additional issues, as well as methods of overcoming them. In addition, we will cover theory and usage, and general advantages and disadvantages.\n"},"usage.html":{"url":"usage.html","title":"Usage","keywords":"","body":"Usage\nClustering algorithms like K-means are good for many tasks in the data-driven world.

Eventually, they will stop moving, at which point the algorithm has converged. The centroids are initialized randomly, though it is common to initialize them as far apart as possible. The iterative process moves through 2 alternating stages, the expectation or E step, and the maximization or M step.\nE Step: At the E step we assign each data point to its nearest centroid, forming a cluster for each centroid, and assigning every point in the set to one cluster.\nM Step: At the M step we move the centroids to the mean of their respective clusters.\nNotice that after the M step, the distances between the centroids and any points may have changed. We then return to the E step, re-assigning every point to clusters according to the new distances. This process may be looped until convergence, at which point the algorithm may return the final clusters.\nLet’s derive our formal algorithm as described above:\nStart: Randomly initialize a guess of k centers\nStep 1: Assign all points to the the centroid closest to them.\n\n    \n\n\n\nFind the distances between all points to all all centroids, forming a K \\times n matrix\nAssign each point n to the index of the closest centroid\n\nStep 2: Update the centroids:\n\n    \n\n\n\nTake each centroid and move to the average of its assigned data-points.\n\nStep 3: Repeat until the centroids stop moving.\n\n    \n\n\nDifferent colors represent a different assigned cluster, centroids denoted by ‘+’.\n"},"weaknesses-and-fixes-of-k-means.html":{"url":"weaknesses-and-fixes-of-k-means.html","title":"Weaknesses and Fixes of K-Means","keywords":"","body":"Weaknesses and Fixes of K-means\nK-means can be viewed as a greedy algorithm for partitioning the n samples into k clusters so as to minimize the sum of the squared distances to the cluster centers. Although it is a very efficient algorithm, it does have some weaknesses:\n\nThe way to initialize the means was not specified. One popular way to start is to randomly choose K of the samples, but it can also go wrong.\nThe results produced depend on the initial values for the means. The standard solution is to try a number of different starting points.\nEven for a set of parameters, the K-means algorithm might produce different clusters for each initial set of centroids. This issue is called instability.\nIt can happen that the set of samples closest to centroid is empty, so that centroid cannot be updated. This is an annoyance that must be handled in an implementation, but that we shall ignore.\nThe results depend on the metric used to measure the distance. A popular solution is to normalize each variable by its standard deviation, though this is not always desirable.\nThe results depend on the value of K. The fix below solves this issue, but is extremely costly to run.\n\nThe sensitivity to the number of clusters, K, is an especially famous and problematic concern. There is however, an extremely useful mathematical trick that makes K-means usable. This trick simultaneously solves the sensitivity to K, as well as the sensitivity to initial means. In general, the ideal value of K tends to produce the most stable solutions for a dataset. Specifically, if you run K-means many times, and log the clusters that result from every run, you’ll find that some values of K tend to produce the same clusters despite varying initial conditions. Given this fact, we can choose K to be the number of clusters that produces the most stable results across many trials.\n\n    \n\n"}}}
