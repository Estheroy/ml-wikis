to Machine Learning\nIn this article, we include the basic nomenclature of machine learning, including task types and learning types.

Machine learning is often split into several task fields, most famously regression, classification, generation, and pattern discovery. This can be further split into several learning types, which include supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning. These task fields can be further split by data-type, yielding, among others, sub-fields like image classification, image captioning, speech generation, topic classification, etc. Here we will learn theory and standard nomenclature, a few examples of models, and some general facts about machine learning at large.\nWe'd like to stress that every method within the field is in a very strong sense unique. It has its own formalism, its own background, history, intended usage, and very precise advantages and disadvantages. There is no general purpose theory that elucidates all of machine learning. Like any other enterprise, this devil is in its details.\nThat being said, there are some commonalities. We’ll be describing machine learning term-wise and piece-wise, here and in other articles. You’ll notice that everything described below assumes competency with the nature of data science in general. We expect that you understand what a feature space is, and correspondingly, what it means to have a dataset represented as a matrix or array. All these methods work under the assumption that there is some usable pattern in feature space that corresponds to the classes that we, as humans, assign.\nThe underlying formalism that allows one to ‘unify’ all machine learning models is the field of probability and statistics, specifically within the study of stochastic processes. We urge the user to familiarize themselves with the field if they wish to work within the theoretical, formal areas of machine learning. A piece-wise understand will do for engineers or scientists interested in expanding their skill-set.\n"},"theory-and-standards.html":{"url":"theory-and-standards.html","title":"Theory and Standards","keywords":"","body":"Theory and Standards\n\n  \n\n\nAll programs that “learn” are typically referred to as “models.” Any model will have at least two stages before it can be applied in an engineering setting: a training stage, also known as a “fitting” stage, where the model is given a training dataset to learn patterns on, and a testing stage, where the performance of the model is tested on previously unseen data. Each method will have it’s own logic for what training and testing explicitly entails, no two are alike.\nMany machine learning authorities and resources will talk about a validation stage. Validation means different things to different people. ‘Validation’ can be synonymous with ‘testing,’ the way we used it above, but can also refer to the process of holding out sections of training data to test on with different configurations of some model. In this way, we are ‘validating’ sets of hyper-parameters, or deciding what configuration is ideal.\nHyper-parameters refers to user specified inputs that the algorithm keeps and uses for certain steps. They are separate from parameters, which are values internal to the algorithm that are changed or updated as part of the algorithms natural progression. An example of a hyper-parameter is the number of clusters, or categories, you’d like some method to find. An example of a parameter is a set of numbers that define a boundary, that changes as your model trains.\n"},"task-types.html":{"url":"task-types.html","title":"Task Types","keywords":"","body":"Task Types\nMachine learning methods can be grouped by task type. Type refers to the sort of tasks that a method can be used for. The major tasks and associated model types are listed here:\n\n  \n\n\nClassification\nTasks that involve returning a class specific label for each datapoint. This is used when you have a finite set of possible classes that you want a method to determine and return. Methods that can perform classification are commonly called classifiers. A clear example is that of deciding if a fish is a salmon, trout, or tuna, based on an image of it fed into the classifier.\nClassifiers can be further separated into binary or multi-class. Binary classifiers can only work when there are two target classes to be identified. Multi-class refers to the range of classifiers that can work on any number of target classes.\n\n  \n\n\n\nRegression\nTasks that involve returning a value for each datapoint. This is used when you have an infinite number of valid return values, or when the value you’re trying to predict is ordinal. Classification and regression are easily mistaken. A common regression task of predicting a house’ value based on its age, location, presence of a pool, condition, etc. The values to predict are not categories, but a value along an ordinal scale. Compare this to classifying maple vs oak trees; in the latter case, we only want two output values, one for oak, one for maple.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nGeneration\nTasks that involve creating an entirely new example of some class, as opposed to returning a value for some new example as an input. A, rather heinous, early example: creating an image of a face that a person is likely to fall in love with, given a set of faces that person is attracted to.\n\n  \n\n\n\nPattern Discovery\nThese methods assign points in the training data to certain categories, or find interesting manifolds or patterns in a dataset that can explain that dataset. These are most often found in clustering methods. Technically, curving a class’ grades would be an example of pattern discovery methods. In general, if the method is teaching the user about their dataset, as opposed to learning from the dataset for some other task, then the method is performing pattern discovery.\n"},"learning-types.html":{"url":"learning-types.html","title":"Learning Types","keywords":"","body":"Learning Types\nMachine learning methods can also be grouped by a learning type. Learning type refers to the presence and variety of label in the training data. The common learning types are listed:\n\n\n\n\nSupervised Learning\nSupervised learning methods are trained using labeled examples. For example, a piece of equipment could have data points labeled either “F” (failed) or “R” (runs). The learning algorithm receives a training set with the corresponding correct outputs, and the algorithm learns how to output ‘F’ or ‘R’ to match the training set. The idea is that the patterns it learned in the training set will also generalize to new examples.\n\n\n\n\nUnsupervised Learning\nUnsupervised learning is used for data that has no labels. The system is not told the \"right answer\" for any point. The algorithm discover or match patterns in the data itself. Unsupervised learning is very closely linked to pattern discovery, but the two are separate concepts. Unsupervised learning can be used for classification, and supervised learning can be used for pattern discovery.\n\n  \n\n\nSemi-Supervised Learning\nSemi-supervised learning labels data to allow for supervised learning. Typically a small amount of labeled data is put through pattern discovery with a large amount of unlabeled data. This allows the unlabelled data to be assigned to a class, which is then trained on in a supervised way. Semi-supervised learning is useful when the cost associated with labeling is too high to allow for a fully labeled training process.\n\n  \n\n\n\nReinforcement Learning\nReinforcement learning is often used for robotics, gaming and navigation. With reinforcement learning, the algorithm discovers through trial and error which actions yield the greatest rewards. This type of learning has three primary components: the agent (the learner or decision maker), the environment (everything the agent interacts with) and actions (what the agent can do). The objective is for the agent to choose actions that maximize the expected reward for an action or policy.\n\n  \n\n\nOverfitting is an essential concept in machine learning. Overfitting refers to the tendency of certain overly complex or sensitive models to learn the unique, accidental characteristics of the training data, as opposed to the underlying pattern that generated it. Because these functions have learned something other than the true pattern, their performance on the training data might not be repeated for data it has not been trained on yet. When a model has high training accuracy, but low testing accuracy, we say that model does not generalize well. Regularization is the term for techniques that constrain the model so that it will only learn the true patterns as opposed to random, dataset specific permutations. Many models and methods have been designed to generalize well, meaning that they learn simpler, more efficient functions that are likely to correspond to real patterns.\n"},"evolution-of-machine-learning.html":{"url":"evolution-of-machine-learning.html","title":"Evolution of Machine Learning","keywords":"","body":"Evolution of Machine Learning\nBecause of new computing technologies, machine learning today is not like machine learning of the past. During its nascent stage, machine learning was concerned more with mathematical theory, and intelligent, strong, efficient algorithms. This makes sense given the computational constraints of the time. Recently, huge computational power, and an exponential increase in space and time has changed the face of the field. Machine learning is still interested in intelligent, powerful algorithms, but it’s less concerned with efficiency. Huge algorithms that can learn from huge sets of examples have taken the place of quick learning, small algorithms. These large algorithms tend to be capable of performing more operations, and we’re seeing more and more single methods that can do everything that’s talked about in ML. Machine learning is not a new science, but it’s only beginning to ripen.\nHere are a few widely publicized examples of machine learning applications you may be familiar with:\n\nSelf-driving cars: Regression with reinforcement learning\nRecommender systems, like those found in Amazon and Netflix: Clustering methods, predictive classifiers, and a whole lot of semi-supervised\nTwitter scrappers: Natural language processing based in classification and regression models, with semi-supervised learning.\nFraud detection: Classifiers and regressors with supervised learning.\n\n"},"who-is-using-machine-learning.html":{"url":"who-is-using-machine-learning.html","title":"Who is Using Machine Learning?","keywords":"","body":"Who is Using Machine Learning?\nMost industries working with large amounts of data have recognized the value of machine learning technology. By gleaning insights from this data – often in real time – organizations are able to work more efficiently or gain an advantage over competitors.\n\n  \n\n\nFinancial Services\nBanks and other businesses in the financial industry use machine learning technology for two key purposes: to identify important insights in data, and prevent fraud. The insights can identify investment opportunities, or help investors know when to trade. Data mining can also identify clients with high-risk profiles, or use cybersurveillance to pinpoint warning signs of fraud.\n\n  \n\n\nGovernment\nGovernment agencies such as public safety and utilities have a particular need for machine learning since they have multiple sources of data that can be mined for insights. Analyzing sensor data, for example, identifies ways to increase efficiency and save money. Machine learning can also help detect fraud and minimize identity theft.\n\n  \n\n\nHealth Care\nMachine learning is a fast-growing trend in the healthcare industry, thanks to the advent of wearable devices and sensors that can use data to assess a patient's health in real time. The technology can also help medical experts analyze data to identify trends or red flags that may lead to improved diagnoses and treatment.\n\n  \n\n\nMarketing and Sales\nWebsites recommending items you might like based on previous purchases are using machine learning to analyze your buying history – and promote other items you'd be interested in. This ability to capture data, analyze it and use it to personalize a shopping experience (or implement a marketing campaign) is the future of retail.\n\n  \n\n\nOil and Gas\nFinding new energy sources. Analyzing minerals in the ground. Predicting refinery sensor failure. Streamlining oil distribution to make it more efficient and cost-effective. The number of machine learning use cases for this industry is vast – and still expanding.\n\n  \n\n\nTransportation\nAnalyzing data to identify patterns and trends is key to the transportation industry, which relies on making routes more efficient and predicting potential problems to increase profitability. The data analysis and modeling aspects of machine learning are important tools to delivery companies, public transportation and other transportation organizations.\n"},"what-are-some-popular-machine-learning-methods.html":{"url":"what-are-some-popular-machine-learning-methods.html","title":"What are some popular Machine Learning Methods?","keywords":"","body":"What are some popular Machine Learning Methods?\n\nParametric classifiers and regressors:\nPerceptron\nSupport vector machines\nIncluding kernel support vector machines\n\n\nArtificial neurons, including logistic regression\nNeural networks and deep learning\nIncluding convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks\n\n\nLDA and Fischer’s discriminant classifiers\nConditional and Markovian random fields (for structures or sequences)\nHidden markov model (for structures or sequences)\nDirect model regressors, including linear regression, and quadratic regression.\n\n\nNon-parametric Classifiers\nKNN\nDecision tree\nRandom Forest\nRandom Fern\nMaximum A Posteriori methods\nEspecially the naive Bayes classifier\n\n\n\n\nPattern Discovery and Clustering\nPartial Component Analysis\nIndependent component analysis\nNeural networks and deep learning\nSpecifically deep belief networks\n\n\nHierarchical clustering\nExpectation-Maximization\nK-means (sometimes included in EM)\nMean shift\n\n\nGenerative\nNeural networks and deep learning\nEspecially deep belief networks and generative adversarial networks\nHidden Markov Models\nConditional and markovian random fields\n\n\n\n"}}}
