For example, as you read this essay, you understand each word based on previous words you’ve read. This is true in a sentence, and also true across sentences and paragraphs; knowledge builds based on memory. For a sequence, where a later feature is dependent on an earlier one, it’s natural to use information gathered from earlier steps in the sequence to make inferences from the later.\nTraditional neural networks can’t do this, and it seems like a major shortcoming. For example, imagine you want to classify what kind of event is happening at every point in a movie. It’s unclear how a traditional neural network could use knowledge gleaned from previous events in the film to inform later ones. A traditional network would attempt to apply the same computation to every frame, or a frame every second, totally agnostic to what may have occurred in previous frames. Recurrent neural networks address this issue. They are networks with internal states that persist through time, and so allow for time-dependent calculations to occur.\nThe idea behind RNNs is to make use of sequential information. In a traditional neural network we assume that all inputs (and outputs) are independent of each other. But for many tasks that’s a very poor assumption. If you want to predict the next word in a sentence the minimal amount you’d need to do this is a few words preceding it. RNNs are called recurrent because they perform the same task for every element of a sequence, with the output being dependent on outputs for previous elements in the sequence. Another way to think about RNNs is that they have “memory” which captures information about what has been calculated so far. In theory RNNs can make use of information in arbitrarily long sequences, but in practice they are limited to looking back only a few steps.\n\n‘Loop’ diagram of an RNN. This is the core module that is repeated for every element in a sequence\nIn the above diagram, a chunk of neural network, A, looks at some input xt and outputs a value ht. A loop allows information to be passed from one step of the network to the next. These loops might make recurrent neural networks seem a bit mysterious. However, if you think carefully, it turns out that they aren’t all that different than a normal neural network. A recurrent neural network can be thought of as multiple copies of the same network, each passing a message to a successor. Consider what happens if we unroll the loop through time:\n\nAn unrolled recurrent neural network. Forward in the sequence is to the right in this diagram.\nIn this diagram, we see that successive data points in a sequence are all fed into the hidden layer. This layer, however, also takes an input from the previous copy of itself, and feeds output into the next copy of itself. This chain-like nature reveals that recurrent neural networks are intimately related to sequences and lists. They’re the natural deep learning architecture to use for such data. And they certainly are used! In the last few years, there has been incredible success applying RNNs to a variety of problems: speech recognition, language modeling, translation, image captioning… The list goes on.  This fun post by Andrej Karpathy demonstrates what character-level language models based on RNNs are capable of.\n"},"theory-and-implementation-of-rnn.html":{"url":"theory-and-implementation-of-rnn.html","title":"Theory and Implementation of RNN","keywords":"","body":"Theory and Implementation of RNN\nFORWARD LEARNING\nTraining a RNN is similar to training a traditional Neural Network. Let’s get concrete and see what the RNN looks like. \n\nThen, the forward calculation for each step will be exactly same as traditional neural networks:\n\n\\begin{gather*}\ns_t = tanh(Ux_t + Ws_t - 1)\\\\\no_t = softmax(Vs_t)\n\\end{gather*}\n\nBACKPROPAGATE THE LOSS\nTo train, we will use the backpropagation algorithm, but with a little twist. Because the parameters are shared by all time steps in the network, the gradient at each output depends not only on the calculations of the current time step, but also the previous time steps. \n\nFor example, in order to calculate the gradient at t=3, we would need to backpropagate 3 steps and sum up the gradients. \n\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\frac{\\partial E_3}{\\partial W} =\\sum^3_{k=0}\\frac{\\partial E_3}{\\partial \\hat{y}_3}\n\\frac{\\partial \\hat{y}_3}{\\partial s_3}\\left(\\prod^3_{j=k+1}\\frac{\\partial s_j}{\\partial s_{j-1}}\\right)\\frac{\\partial s_k}{\\partial W}\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\nThis is called Back propagation Through Time (BPTT). Be aware of the fact that vanilla RNNs trained with BPTT have difficulties learning long-term dependencies (e.g. dependencies between steps that are far apart) due to what is called the vanishing/exploding gradient problem, which is the next section. There exists some machinery to deal with these problems, and certain types of RNNs (like LSTMs) were specifically designed to get around them.\nCALCULATING THE LOSS\nTo train our network we need a way to measure the errors it makes. We call this the loss function L, and our goal is find the parameters W, V and W that minimize the loss function for our training data. A common choice for the loss function is the cross-entropy loss. If we have N training examples (words in our text) and C classes (the size of our vocabulary) then the loss with respect to our predictions O and the true labels y is given by:\n\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nL(y,o) = -\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n\\in N}y_n\\log O_n\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\nThe formula looks a bit complicated, but all it really does is sum over our training examples and add to the loss based on how off our prediction are.\n"},"the-problem-of-long-term-dependencies.html":{"url":"the-problem-of-long-term-dependencies.html","title":"The Problem of Long-Term Dependencies","keywords":"","body":"The Problem of Long-Term Dependencies\nOne of the appeals of RNNs is the idea that they might be able to connect previous information to the present task, such as using previous video frames might inform the understanding of the present frame. If RNNs could do this, they’d be extremely useful. But can they? It depends. For some tasks, we only need to look at recent information. For example, consider a language model trying to predict the next word in a sentence based on the previous words and sentences. If we are trying to predict the last word in “the clouds are in the sky,” we don’t need any previous sentences, – it’s pretty obvious the next word is going to be sky. In such cases, where the gap between the relevant information and the place that it’s needed is small, RNNs can learn to use the past information.\n\nThere are also cases where we need more context. Consider trying to predict the last word in the text “I speak fluent French.” Recent information suggests that the next word is probably the name of a language, but if we want to narrow down which language, we need the context the sentence, like a reference to France, from sentences further back. It’s entirely possible for the gap between the relevant information and the point where it is needed to become very large. Unfortunately, as that gap grows, RNNs become unable to learn to connect the information.\n\nIn theory, RNNs are absolutely capable of handling such “long-term dependencies.” A human could carefully pick parameters for them to solve toy problems of this form. Sadly, in practice, RNNs don’t seem to be able to learn them. The problem was explored in depth by Hochreiter (1991) [German] and Bengio, et al. (1994), who found some pretty fundamental reasons why it might be difficult.\nTo put it simple, when we train RNN, we will also use backpropagation algorithm to adjust error of the parameters. Let’s take gradient at t=3 as an example, the derivative will look like this:\n\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\frac{\\partial E_3}{\\partial W} =\\sum^3_{k=0}\\frac{\\partial E_3}{\\partial \\hat{y}_3}\n\\frac{\\partial \\hat{y}_3}{\\partial s_3}\\left(\\prod^3_{j=k+1}\\frac{\\partial s_j}{\\partial s_{j-1}}\\right)\\frac{\\partial s_k}{\\partial W}\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\nDon’t worry if you don’t completely follow the above. In RNN, we need to sum up the contributions of each time step to the gradient. In other words, because W is used in every step up to the output we care about, we need to backpropagate gradients from t=3 through the network all the way to t=0 in this case:\n\nNote that this is exactly the same as the standard backpropagation algorithm that we use in deep Feedforward Neural Networks. The key difference is that we sum up the gradients for W across each time step. This should also give you an idea of why standard RNNs are hard to train: Sequences (sentences) can be quite long, perhaps 20 words or more, and thus you need to back-propagate through many layers. It is natural for this error signal to get muddied up by noise and imprecision. In practice many people truncate the backpropagation to a few steps.\n"},"vanishing-gradient.html":{"url":"vanishing-gradient.html","title":"Vanishing Gradient","keywords":"","body":"Vanishing Gradient\nLet’s take a closer look at the gradient we calculated above: Note that \\frac{\\partial s_3}{\\partial s_k} is a chain rule in itself! For example, \\frac{\\partial s_3}{\\partial s_1}=\\frac{\\partial s_3}{\\partial s_2}\\frac{\\partial s_2}{\\partial s_1}. Also note that because we are taking the derivative of a vector function with respect to a vector, the result is a matrix (called the Jacobian matrix) whose elements are all the pointwise derivatives. We can rewrite the above gradient:\n\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\frac{\\partial E_3}{\\partial W} =\\sum^3_{k=0}\\frac{\\partial E_3}{\\partial \\hat{y}_3}\n\\frac{\\partial \\hat{y}_3}{\\partial s_3}\\left(\\prod^3_{j=k+1}\\frac{\\partial s_j}{\\partial s_{j-1}}\\right)\\frac{\\partial s_k}{\\partial W}\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\nIt turns out tanh activation function maps all values into a range between -1 and 1, and the derivative is bounded by 1 (1/4 in the case of sigmoid) as well. You can see that the tanh and sigmoid functions have derivatives of 0 at both ends. They approach a  flat line. When this happens we say the corresponding neurons are saturated. They have a zero gradient and drive other gradients in previous layers towards 0. Thus, with small values in the matrix and multiple matrix multiplications (t-k in particular) the gradient values are shrinking exponentially fast, eventually vanishing completely after a few time steps. Gradient contributions from “far away” steps become zero, and the state at those steps doesn’t contribute to what you are learning: You end up not learning long-range dependencies. This is called the vanishing gradient problem. Vanishing gradients aren’t exclusive to RNNs. They also happen in deep Feedforward Neural Networks. It’s just that RNNs tend to be very deep (as deep as the sentence length in our case), which makes the problem a lot more common.\n\nBesides truncating the error range, as described above, a common solution is to use ReLU instead of tanh or sigmoid activation functions. The ReLU derivative is a constant of either 0 or 1, so it isn’t as likely to suffer from vanishing gradients. An even more popular solution is to use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures. LSTMs were first proposed in 1997 and are the perhaps most widely used models in NLP today. GRU's, first proposed in 2014, are simplified versions of LSTMs. Both of these RNN architectures were explicitly designed to deal with vanishing gradients and efficiently learn long-range dependencies. Both, however, require a strong understanding or plain old RNNs, so it’s a good thing you’re reading this!\n"},"what-can-rnns-do.html":{"url":"what-can-rnns-do.html","title":"What can RNNs do","keywords":"","body":"What can RNNs do\nRNNs have shown great success in many NLP tasks. At this point I should mention that the most commonly used type of RNNs are LSTMs, which are much better at capturing long-term dependencies than vanilla RNNs are. But don’t worry, LSTMs are essentially the same thing as the RNN we will develop in this tutorial, they’re just a bit more complicated. \n1.LANGUAGE MODELING AND GENERATING TEXT\nIt is very nature to implement RNN as a language model since language can be seen as the sequence data. Given a sequence of words we want to predict the probability of each word given the previous words. Language Models allow us to measure how likely a sentence is, which is an important input for Machine Translation since high-probability sentences are typically correct. A side-effect of being able to predict the next word is that we get a generative model, which allows us to generate new text by sampling from the output probabilities. And depending on what our training data is we can generate all kinds of stuff. In Language Modeling our input is typically a sequence of words (encoded as one-hot vectors for example), and our output is the sequence of predicted words. When training the network we set O_t = X_t + 1 (O is the output and X is the input at step t) since we want the output at step t to be the actual next word.\n\nRNN based language model\nResearch papers about Language Modeling and Generating Text:\n\nRecurrent neural network based language model\nExtensions of Recurrent neural network based language model\nGenerating Text with Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n2.MACHINE TRANSLATION\nMachine Translation is similar to language modeling in that our input is a sequence of words in our source language (e.g. German). We want to output a sequence of words in our target language (e.g. English). A key difference is that our output only starts after we have seen the complete input, because the first word of our translated sentences may require information captured from the complete input sequence.\n\nRNN for Machine Translation\nResearch papers about Machine Translation:\n\nA Recursive Recurrent Neural Network for Statistical Machine Translation\nSequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks\nJoint Language and Translation Modeling with Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n3.SPEECH RECOGNITION\n\nSpeech Recognition with Recurrent Neural Networks\nGiven an input sequence of acoustic signals from a sound wave, we can predict a sequence of phonetic segments together with their probabilities.\nResearch papers about Speech Recognition:\n\nTowards End-to-End Speech Recognition with Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n4.GENERATING IMAGE DESCRIPTIONS\nTogether with convolutional Neural Networks, RNNs have been used as part of a model to generate descriptions for unlabeled images.

We will cover them in more detail in a later post, but I want this section to serve as a brief overview so that you are familiar with the taxonomy of models.\nBidirectional RNNs:\nBidirectional RNNs based on the idea that the output at time t may not only depend on the previous elements in the sequence, but also future elements. For example, to predict a missing word in a sequence you want to look at both the left and the right context. Bidirectional RNNs are quite simple. They are just two RNNs stacked on top of each other. The output is then computed based on the hidden state of both RNNs.\n\nDeep (Bidirectional) RNNs:\nDeep (Bidirectional) RNNs are similar to Bidirectional RNNs, only that we now have multiple layers per time step. In practice this gives us a higher learning capacity (but we also need a lot of training data).\n\nLSTM networks:\nLSTM networks are quite popular these days and we briefly talked about them above. LSTMs don’t have a fundamentally different architecture from RNNs, but they use a different function to compute the hidden state. The memory in LSTMs are called cells and you can think of them as black boxes that take as input the previous state ht-1 and current input xt. Internally these cells  decide what to keep in (and what to erase from) memory. They then combine the previous state, the current memory, and the input. It turns out that these types of units are very efficient at capturing long-term dependencies. LSTMs can be quite confusing in the beginning but if you’re interested in learning more this section has an excellent explanation.\n"},"reference.html":{"url":"reference.html","title":"Reference","keywords":"","body":"Reference\nhttp://cs224d.stanford.edu/lectures/CS224d-Lecture8.pdf\nhttp://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/deepimagesent/\nhttp://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-1-introduction-to-rnns/\nhttp://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-2-implementing-a-language-model-rnn-with-python-numpy-and-theano/\nhttp://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/\nhttp://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/\n"}}}
