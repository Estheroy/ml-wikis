For any input $$x\\subset\\Re^n$$, a perceptron maps that vector to the set $${0,1}$$. The perceptron is used in this way to map each point in some feature space to two possible labels. It is used for supervised learning tasks, where a set of or training points is provided together with a set of true labels. The perceptron can learn from these examples and assign labels to previously unseen points.\nThe perceptron is a parametric model in that, once it is trained, it has a set number of weights that it uses to assign labels to new points. This article covers the exact training process, by which an ideal set of weights is found, in a later section. For this section we will explain how a perceptron uses these weights, and what they correspond to mathematically and functionally. Note that the terms “set of weights” and “weight vector” are used interchangeably. \nPart of the perceptron model is that it computes an explicit decision boundary, which is very closely related to the weights. A decision boundary is a line, plane, or hyper-plane, (depending on the dimensionality of the input,) that is used to partition the feature space into two disjoint regions corresponding to either class. Every point above a decision boundary is assigned one class, every point below it is assigned the other.\n\nTraining a perceptron is functionally equivalent to finding just such a line for a training set, with the hope that the line would work for any new point. This is based, like all classifiers, on the assumption that all points of a class should inhabit the same region of feature space, and that different classes should inhabit different regions of feature space. Even though the perceptron classifies a new point by performing mathematical operations on it, we can visualize the predictions it would make with this decision boundary.\nThe perceptron, like all models, does this by using intelligent mathematical operations. It performs a set of operations on any given vector in the feature space, and the output of those operations will correspond to the value of the assigned class. Below is a formal explanation of the process of classification.    \nIn its basic form the perceptron can be functionally visualized as below. \n\nIn this case, the vector x is an input vector of dimensionality $$n$$, $$x \\subset\\Re^n$$, whose elements of are the values $$x_1, \\cdots, x_n$$. Note that a ‘1’ is concatenated to the front of any input vector. These values are all multiplied by a corresponding weight ($$w_0$$ to $$w_n$$). w1 to wn are called correlating weights, and w0, which is multiplied against the ‘1,’ is called the bias. These products are all summed, generating a ‘weighted sum’ of the inputs. Note that this weighted sum is equal to the dot product of the x vector and a vector of the weights, $$w$$, such that\n$$\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nw0 + x_1w_1 + x_2w_2 + \\cdots + x_nw_n = \\vec{w} \\cdot \\vec{x}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n$$\nwhere $$\\vec{x} = , \\vec{w} = $$\nThis weighted sum is then put through a step function, which is a function with an output space of {0,1} that has the form:\n$$\ns(x) = \\left{\n        \\begin{array}{ll}\n            1 & \\quad x \\geq 0 \\\n            0 & \\quad x \n$$\nPut simply, this function just checks the sign of its input, and returns 0 if the input is negative, 1 otherwise.\nTaken all together, the perceptron classification operation, or model, is simply\n$$\\hat{y} = s(\\vec{w} \\cdot \\vec{x}) $$\nWhere the left side of the equation is the perceptron models predicted label for a point,  $$s$$ is the step function described above, and the dot product $$w \\cdot x$$ is equal to the weighted sum, as described above. Notice how this operation corresponds perfectly to the diagram of the perceptron structure shown above.\nLet’s consider the decision boundary. Our classification operation can be visualized with the decision boundary, where the decision boundary is given simply by the equation:\n$$\\vec{w} \\cdot \\vec{x} = 0$$\nWhich defines a hyperplane in n dimensional space, with intercept $$w_0$$.\n\nNotice that the region where the dot product of the input and weights is positive, which is where our classifier would return a 1, will fall above the decision boundary, and the region where the product is negative, where any point would be classified as negative, will fall below the decision boundary. \n"},"perceptron-learning-algorithm.html":{"url":"perceptron-learning-algorithm.html","title":"Perceptron Learning Algorithm","keywords":"","body":"Perceptron Learning Algorithm\nThis section explains how an ideal set of weights can be found. The process of finding some ideal parameters for our training data is called training. For training to occur, the perceptron needs to be given a set of training points, or vectors in feature space, as well as a set of corresponding labels per training point. Learning from such a set is called supervised learning, which the perceptron is the first published case of. Let this training set be defined as a matrix $$X$$, where each row of $$X$$ is a datapoint as described above. Recall that for any vector $$xn$$,we always add a 1 to the head of the vector, such that $$x{n,1}$$,or the first term, is always equal to 1.\n$$\nX = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    x{1,1} & x{1,2} & \\dots  & x{1,n} \\\n    x{2,1} & x{2,2} & \\dots  & x{2,n} \\\n    \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\n    x{m,1} & x{m,2} & \\dots  & x_{m,n}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nAnd the set of labels, $$y \\subset \\Re^m$$ is a vector of labels corresponding to each training point. Note that the first subscript here just indexes the identity of a vector, and the second identifies the features of each vector.\nThe ideal set of weights is that set that minimize the classification accuracy on this training set. In the case of the perceptron, this can be done iteratively, by starting with a random set of weights, and then intelligently updating them based on their effect on classification accuracy. This second step is performed iteratively, with the training error improving on every step. Eventually our entire training set is correctly classified, meaning our training error has gone to 0, and we have finished training. The update rule for every iteration of our training algorithm is given in terms of the whole weight vector by \n$$w_{t+1} = w_t + \\eta(y_i - \\hat{y_i}) \\cdot x_i$$\nWhere $$wt$$ is the old weight vector, $$w{t+1}$$ is the new weight value we’re generating, $$\\eta$$ is a user-defined constant called the step size, $$y_i$$ is the true label for some point $$x_i$$, $$\\hat{y_i}$$ is the output of the perceptron for that same point.\nHere Let’s define the formal perceptron learning algorithm:\n\nStep 0: Initialize the weights (however you choose)\nStep 1: Choose a data point. Mark it as the most recent start.\nStep 2: Compute the model output for the datapoint using the model function s, as defined above.\nStep 3: Compare model output to the datapoint’s true label.\nIf they match, go to Step 5!\nIf not, go to Step 4.\n\n\nStep 4: Update weights using perceptron learning rule. \n  $$W_{new} = W_{old} + \\eta(target_i - output_i)\\cdot x_i$$\n  And then, start over on the step 1 with the first data point.\n\nStep 5: Record it as correctly classified, and go to the next data point. Treat the dataset as a ring, meaning that you go back to the first data point after the last one.\n\n\nIf the next data datapoint is the most recent start, meaning you’ve gone through and correctly classified every datapoint without a single update, you’re done!\n"},"convergence-and-limitation.html":{"url":"convergence-and-limitation.html","title":"Convergence and Limitation","keywords":"","body":"Convergence and Limitation\nAlthough the perceptron learning rule is simple, it is quite powerful. In fact, it can be shown that the rule will always successfully find a set of weights that separate the data as shown above, given that such a set exists. The perceptron learning rule is guaranteed to converge to a solution in a finite number of steps, so long as a solution exists. This brings us to an important question. What problems can a perceptron solve? Recall that a perceptron is able to divide the input space into two regions by a linear boundary. If we have a dataset wherein a line can be drawn that separates the two classes we’re interested in, then the perceptron is an excellent choice for classifying on that set, as it is guaranteed to find a working solution. But in reality, very few datasets afford such a simple solution. The dataset for which a perceptron can work is called a linearly separable dataset, which form a very small minority of real world case problems.\nBelow is an example of an AND-gate set, which has two classes, white for 0 and black for 1. We can see that for such a set, the perceptron is guaranteed to find a working solution. \n\nBelow is an example of an XOR-gate set, which has the same classes as above. Notice that there is no line that can separate these four points by class.\n\nThis issue was one of the first to be seriously studied in machine learning. Nowadays, such a problem is extremely trivial. Perceptrons as defined here are just too weak, for all their nice properties, to solve such a task. However, this shouldn’t be taken as a criticism of the method. Our cutting edge methods, especially what we now call deep learning, are ultimately a major extension and abstraction of the perceptron. There is a more general class of classifiers, of which Perceptrons are the first described, simplest, and in some ways weakest, called the artificial neuron, or AN. ANs were designed to overcome the limitations of the perceptron. Perceptrons should be seen as a building block, conceptually and almost literally, of all our current cutting edge methods, and understanding the model is the best way of understanding deep learning at large.\n"}}}
