It is also a core method for many more powerful extensions. Besides applications, we cover theory, implementation, and use of the PCA method.\n\nRaw data collected from the real world can be very noisy or extraneous. PCA is a powerful technique, rooted in Linear Algebra, that addresses this problem. At heart, it is a method of determining the most and least important directions of a dataset, using the data’s intrinsic statistics. Such a determination will allow for intelligent manipulation of the data. The data can then be reduced in dimensionality, which yields a more efficient representation. Alternatively, the data can then be denoised, which reduces the complexity of the data, but preserves its original dimensionality.\n"},"theory-and-knowledge.html":{"url":"theory-and-knowledge.html","title":"Theory and Knowledge","keywords":"","body":"Theory and Knowledge\nPCA requires a firm grasp of post-calculus linear algebra, specifically eigenvectors and eigenvalues, projections, bases, and vector spaces.\nPCA is one of the oldest solutions to the dimensionality reduction problem. The dimensionality reduction problem refers to the ideal way of dropping dimensions for computational simplicity. Consider a simple two-dimensional dataset. The naive method of reducing dimensions is simply to omit some of the dimensions of the corresponding data matrix. Consider the following 2-d image.\n\nThe naive solution would fail in this case, as simply omitting either the x or y values would not preserve the structure of the data. This failing is especially problematic in higher dimensional data. PCA is a more sophisticated solution, and is often the first one taught for this problem.\n\n\nPCA computes the most meaningful directions of the dataset, called the principal components, and uses them as a basis to re-orient a dataset. Once the dataset is in this new space, we can drop dimensions exactly as we would have in the naive solution-by dropping all values of an axis. The principal components are a set of orthogonal vectors that correspond to the directions of greatest to least variance in the data. Once our data is redefined in component space, we simply drop dimensions that corresponded to directions of least variance. In this way, reducing dimensions minimizes loss of structure compared to the naive method.\nIf we were to re-orient the same dataset shown above, we would have:\n\nIn this new orientation, the dimensions of the data themselves are ranked by informativeness. The new x-axis corresponds to the direction of highest information, the new y-axis corresponds to a perpendicular direction that has the second highest amount of information, which is in our case the same as the direction of least variance. (If our data was three dimensional, the second axis would just be the dimension of middle variance, and we would have a third direction, orthogonal to the first two, that points in the least informative direction.) If we just drop the y-axis from this new dataset, the resulting dimensionality reduction solution will be better than the naive.\n\n\nPCA works best on data of high redundancy. As you can see, plot a, b, c are all of two-dimensional data. However, in plot a, the variables r1 and r2 seems to be uncorrelated. This state is called low redundancy. In r1 and r2 the data is correlated enough to be efficiently represented in one dimension. This would mean a 50% decrease in storage without any penalty in usefulness. Data that can be, without loss, represented in fewer dimensions are said to have high redundancy.\n"},"how-it-works.html":{"url":"how-it-works.html","title":"How it Works?","keywords":"","body":"How it Works?\nPCA finds the direction of greatest information by computing the directions of greatest variance, and then projecting the dataset onto vectors that correspond to those directions. This is because redundancy can be quantified with variance and covariance.\nThe directions of greatest variance in a dataset are given by the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of that dataset, which in turn is given by variance and covariance. Variance is a measure of the spread of one variable. Covariance is a measure of the spread between two variables. Formally, the two are similar:\nvar(x) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-\\bar{x})^{2}}{n}\ncov(x,y) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-\\bar{x})(y_{i}-\\bar{y})}{n}\nHere, \\bar{x} and \\bar{y} refer to the mean of x and y, respectively.\nThe covariance matrix, which is central to PCA, is composed of all variance and covariance measures of our dataset. The (i,j)^{th} element of the matrix is the covariance between i-th and j-th variable. For 3 dimensions, the covariance matrix C is given by:\nC = \\begin{bmatrix}\nCov(X,X) & Cov(X,Y) & Cov(X,Z)\\\\ \nCov(Y,X) &  Cov(Y,Y)&  Cov(Y,Z)\\\\ \nCov(Z,X) &  Cov(Y,Z)& Cov(Z,Z)\n\\end{bmatrix}\nWhere Cov(X,X) refers to Var(X). Notice that for a D-dimensional dataset, we will always have a DxD covariance matrix.\nA matrix A has an eigenvector v with the associated eigenvalue \\lambda ifAv = \\lambda v\nwhere A is a square matrix, v is a column vector, and \\lambda is a scalar. For an NxN square matrix, there are always N eigenvectors with associated eigenvalues for that matrix.\nEigenvectors have many useful properties that are leveraged in science and engineering, but the exact reasons behind why they’re so essential to PCA is outside the scope of this article. It will suffice to say that the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix correspond to the directions of ranked variance described above. Specifically, the eigenvector of the covariance matrix with the largest eigenvalue always points to the direction of greatest variance in the data. This is called the first eigenvector. The second eigenvector points in the direction that has the largest variance of all those directions that are orthogonal to the first eigenvector. The third eigenvector, correspondingly, points in the direction that has the largest variance of all directions orthogonal to both the first and second eigenvectors, and so on. Once found, the eigenvectors are sorted by eigenvalue, and the resulting vectors are known as the principal components of a dataset.\nProjecting a dataset onto a new axis can be accomplished with matrix multiplication. Specifically, for a matrix D, with rows as dimensions and columns as data points, along with a basis V, whose columns are directions we are mapping onto, the re-orientation, or projection, T, of the dataset D by the columns of V is given by the product:\nV^{*} D = T\nWhere the asterisk mark denotes a transpose.\nBecause the eigenvectors are orthogonal, they form an ideal basis, and because they are ranked by variance, they inform the user as to which directions can be dropped once the data has been redefined in component space. This means that the resulting matrix, T, which has the same shape as D, can be reduced by the N dimensions of least variance, simply by removing its bottom N rows.\nIf this is performed, data can be left in the projected space, called the component space, or can be projected back into its original dimensionality, a process can reconstructing. If a reduced dataset is reconstructed back into its original basis, it will be, in its original space, flattened along the directions of least variance. This latter process is often referred to as de-noising.\n\nWe can distill PCA into the following steps:\nLet our original data be the following plot\n1 – Subtract the mean vector from each of the dimensions\nThis produces a dataset whose mean is zero called, called Zero Mean Data. Subtracting the mean simplifies the process of calculating the covariance matrix. This yields the plot on the right (note the axis label):\n2 – Compute principal components by calculating and ranking by eigenvalue the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix\nAs described above, the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix correspond to orthogonal directions of variance. When ordered by eigenvalue, they form the principal components. The following plot shows the same dataset, with the principal components directions highlighted in red and green.\n5 – Project the data into component space.\nThis makes it so that the dimensions of our dataset are now ranked by variance. Specifically, the x-axis now aligns with widest spread, the y-axis with narrowest.\n6 – Choose and apply application.\nAt this point, the user can choose to reduce dimensions or denoise.\nReducing dimensions is just a matter of dropping values of the least informative directions in in component space. This means a smaller dataset that preserves the data’s original structure, seen in the following plot.\nReconstructing, on the other hand, means re-projecting the reduced data back to the original space. This doesn’t make the set smaller to store, but it does remove noise and can improve successive steps in the project. The following plot illustrates this, and shows the original dataset in blue with its reconstruction in black.\n"},"application-of-pca.html":{"url":"application-of-pca.html","title":"Application of PCA","keywords":"","body":"Application of PCA\nPCA is famously used as a dimensionality reduction technique in tasks like facial recognition and image compression. It is often used as a visualization tool, allowing for a representative visible projection of some high dimension dataset. The user can plot the first two or three dimensions of the component space to see the general trend of the data. It is also used for finding patterns in any large dataset of high dimensionality, like those found in the field of finance, data mining, bioinformatics, or psychology.\nIt is important to note that one can look at the total percentage of variance accounted for by a principal component. By comparing the sum of all eigenvalues to the sum of any subset of eigenvalues, we can decide how much of the total variance is given by the eigenvectors that correspond to that subset. This allows for an intrinsic heuristic for choosing how many dimensions to reduce by.\nA very famous use of PCA is in facial recognition, where PCA can be used to build a feature extraction method. Consider a dataset of matrices whose elements correspond to brightness values in an image. PCA performed on this dataset yields a set of eigenfaces, which are just the Principal components of the dataset. Any new face can then be projected onto a set of eigenfaces, just as in the generic case. The projection of this new face can then be treated as a feature vector for some classifier, to great effect.\n\n"},"limitation-and-extension-of-pca.html":{"url":"limitation-and-extension-of-pca.html","title":"Limitation and Extension of PCA","keywords":"","body":"Limitation and Extension of PCA\n\nThe directions with largest variance are assumed to be of most interest.\nWe only consider orthogonal transformations (rotations) of the original variables. (Kernel PCA is an extension of PCA that allows non-linear mappings).\nPCA is based only on the mean vector and the covariance matrix of the data. Some distributions (e.g. multivariate normal) are completely characterized by this, but others are not, and PCA will necessarily miss some intrinsically informative elements of data in these distributions.\nDimension reduction can only be achieved if the original variables were correlated. If the original variables were uncorrelated, PCA does nothing, except for ordering them according to their variance.\nPCA is not scale invariant. Data often needs to be normalized.\n\n"},"eigenvectors-and-eigenvalues.html":{"url":"eigenvectors-and-eigenvalues.html","title":"Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues","keywords":"","body":"Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues\nAs we said earlier, PCA tries to find a basis to re-express data. Re-expressing data is done with what’s called a basis. let’s define the term orthonormal basis. In simple terms, a basis is a set of vectors that every point in your space is defined in terms of. In the classic 2-d example, the most commonly assumed basis is the set vectors  and . Every point in 2-d space can be expressed as a linear combination of these two vectors.\nIt’s worth mentioning that you can actually use any two vectors, as long as they’re not zero-length and aren’t multiples of each other, as a basis for 2-d space.\nWe favor basis vectors that are perpendicular to each other and unit all unit length for computational simplicity. This is why we typically use the vectors  and  as these vectors are both length 1, and orthogonal to each other.\nAv = \\lambda v\nEigenvectors and their associated eigenvalues can be easily calculated in any scientific programming language, including python, in a single line.\n"},"reference.html":{"url":"reference.html","title":"Reference","keywords":"","body":"Reference\n\nhttp://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rasbt/pattern_classification/blob/master/dimensionality_reduction/projection/principal_component_analysis.ipynb\nhttp://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2015_pca_in_3_steps.html\nhttp://dai.fmph.uniba.sk/courses/ml/sl/PCA.pdf\nhttps://www.cs.princeton.edu/picasso/mats/PCA-Tutorial-Intuition_jp.pdf\nhttp://stat.ethz.ch/~mmarloes/teaching/fall08/Notes3.pdf\n\n"}}}
