graph traversal) refers to the process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each vertex in a graph or tree. Graph algorithms search a graph starting from some first node. The first node, however chosen, is called the source node. The major difference between those search algorithms is the specific node exploring strategy unique to each. Every search algorithms has its own unique properties and methods. To analysis those algorithms’ property, computer scientists introduced concepts such as branching factor and complete and optimal.\nFor each algorithm, this article will explain and illustrate the steps taken by different search algorithms. For any example presented in this article, we, as humans, can see the full graph and know what nodes are connected to what. For these small examples where we have all the information, it’s easy to miss the point of search algorithms. The algorithms described here are the steps someone should take if they cannot see the whole graph. Specifically, these algorithms work under the idea of exploration, which is that the edges on some node can be known by exploring that node, and that in so doing, new potential routes of exploration are opened up. Our algorithms assume some starting node, and then explore the nodes connected to that start, find the next-level connections in those nodes, and repeat the process using some strategy.\nExploration also yields an additional use. If we explore the goal node, then we will be able to see that we have reached the goal, and our algorithm has finished. Again, this is trivial when the whole graph is visible, but needs to be understood for all the cases where the graph is not so accessible.\n\nBreadth-first search (BFS) is one of the simplest search algorithms. BFS will repeatedly choose the closest unexplored node, explore it, and repeat the process until the whole graph is explored or the desired result is found. The property of breadth-first search is easy to understand and many advanced search algorithms are based on the idea of BFS. \n\nDepth-first search (DFS) is another well-known search algorithm. Starting from the source node DFS will repeatedly explore the deepest reachable unexplored node before backtracking. DFS will repeat this rule until all the nodes are explored or desired result is found. Depth-first search has several useful properties including, famously, space saving. When dealing with a large graph, DFS-like algorithms are usually preferred.\n\n\n\nUniform-cost search (UCS) is also a basic search algorithm. UCS is used for graphs where each edge has its own associated cost. Uniform-cost search will calculate every node’s search path’s cost and always explore the least-cost unvisited node. Uniform-cost search has properties that are very similar to BFS.\n\nDepth-limited search (DLS) is a variation of DFS. It works very similar to DFS except that the program will store a max depth, past which the algorithm will not search. Since depth-limited search is a variation of DFS, its properties are the same as DFS’ except that DLS is guaranteed to end.\n\nIterative deepening search (IDS) is a variation of DLS. It runs DLS repeatedly, with a progressively increasing depth. Iterative deepening search’s properties combine the advantages of BFS and DFS.\n\nBidirectional search is a search algorithm that differs from all previously introduced algorithms. The idea behind bidirectional search is to run two simultaneous searches—one forward from the initial state and the other backward from the goal—hoping that the two searches meet in the middle. If they meet, then the algorithm will find a solution path.\n\n\n"},"graphs-and-trees.html":{"url":"graphs-and-trees.html","title":"Graphs and trees","keywords":"","body":"What are graphs and trees?\nThe graph is an abstract concept in mathematics. A graph is defined as two sets of objects. One of these sets is the node set, which contains all of the ‘nodes’ in the graph. Nodes are also called vertices, and can be thought of as the ‘things,’ in the graph. Some pairs of these nodes are related, or have some abstract relationship between them. This relationship is called an edge, which can be thought of as ‘connections’ between the ‘things’ in the graph. Edges compose the second set of objects in a graph, which is called the edge set. Typically, a graph is depicted in diagrammatic form as a set of dots for the nodes, joined by lines or curves between related nodes depicting the edges. Graphs are used to represent any objects with pair-wise relationships. A very famous example is Facebook, where every user’s profile is connected to a set of other user’s profiles. The profiles can be treated as nodes, and the ‘friend’ relation can be treated as an edge between two profiles.\nEdges can be undirected, which describes a mutual relationship, or directed, in which case they would be describing one-way relationships. Directed edges are usually depicted as pointed arrows. The Facebook example above would be an undirected graph, as ‘friending’ is a two-way relationship. Conversely, someone can be ‘following’ someone else on twitter, without reciprocation. This would describe a directed relationship, and the twitter network would have directed edges. \nIn computer science, graphs are used as a logical fundamental data structure. They are used to define relationships between variables, programs, bits of data, etc. There are many different forms that a graph problem can take. They can range in difficulty from finding a path on a 2D grid, to efficiently searching through web links to find a site, to deciding how the elements in a huge program should run, to analyzing information flow based on connections on twitter, to a model of the economy based on social networks, and to a simulation of all connected neurons in the human brain, all depending on the nature of the graph and what it is meant to represent. At heart, all of these tasks feature a set of objects and a set of relationships between those objects, and so they all must begin with an understanding of graphs. \n\nA graph with 6 vertices and 7 edges\nA Tree is a special case of a graph. Trees are directed graphs, meaning they have only directed edges, which have no cycle. What this means is that if you start at any node in the tree, and move only along edges in the direction they point, you will not be able to revisit any nodes. A tree always has a root node, or first node, and potentially many levels of additional nodes that form a hierarchy.\n\nA tree with 9 vertices\n"},"branching-factor.html":{"url":"branching-factor.html","title":"Branching factor","keywords":"","body":"Branching factor\nIn tree data structures the branching factor is the average number of children at each node.

A queue is like a line at the grocery store, first person in the line is the first person out. \nNow let’s have an example to see how BFS actually works.\nBelow is the graph we will traverse. We also have a queue Q to record the nodes we’ll be exploring. Suppose the source node is node a.\n\nQ:\nAt first, only the node a is reachable.

Also, if exploring each node has the same cost, then BFS is optimal, too. The time complexity of BFS is $$O(B^D)$$. The space complexity of BFS is $$O(B^D)$$ because BFS has to keep all the nodes it needs to explore in memory.

It starts at the root and explores as far as possible along each branch before going back to the upper level. \nNow let’s see how DFS works. Below is the graph we will traverse. Unlike BFS, DFS uses a stack data structure, which we will call S. to record the nodes we’ve explored. Stacks are first in, last out. Meaning that if you join the stack, everyone who gets in after you will leave before you. Think of a stack as a bunch of cars sharing a really long parking space. If two cars are parked behind you, they need to move before you can get out.\nThe DFS algorithm works on the following steps. We add nodes to the stack one at a time, and as soon as a node is put into the stack, it is explored. If it is not connected to any new node, it is immediately removed from the stack. When it is removed, the resulting first node is then re-explored for a new node. If it does connect to new nodes, we add one to the stack, and repeat the process. When the stack is empty, the algorithm has traversed the whole graph, and finished. Obviously, if a goal node is found, then the algorithm ends early.\n Suppose the source node is node a.\n \nS:\nAt first, there is only the node a reachable. So push it into S and mark is as visited.\n\nS: a\nAfter exploring a, now there are three nodes reachable: node b, c and d. Suppose we pick node b, randomly.

However, unlike BFS, DFS is not optimal (if the goal has more than one path from the source that leads to it, then DFS is not guaranteed to find the shortest one).\nThe time complexity of DFS is $$O(B^{Dm})$$ since DFS will search as deep as possible. So, if $$D_m$$ is much larger than D, the time complexity, or number of steps, is terrible. The space complexity of DFS is $$O({BD}_m)$$ which is linear over the branching factor because DFS only needs to record the route it is currently searching on. So in general, DFS is slower than BFS if the graph is relatively sparse. Because, DFS is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution, it has limited use, however, DFS is a strong algorithm for saving space. To solve or reduce the problem of DFS, there exist some variation of DFS such as Depth-limited search and Iterative deepening search which are covered in a proceeding section.\n"},"what-is-uniform-cost-search.html":{"url":"what-is-uniform-cost-search.html","title":"What is uniform-cost search","keywords":"","body":"What is uniform-cost search?\nUniform-cost search (UCS) is a search algorithm that works on search graphs whose edges do not have the same cost. In the previous examples, we did not mention or define any edge costs. In doing so, we treated every node as having the same cost. The cost of an edge can be interpreted as a value or loss that occurs when that edge is traversed. Mathematically, a cost is just a scalar value associated with some edge, and graphs with non-uniform cost edges tend to have a cost for every edge. Such a graph is known as a weighted graph.\nInstead of exploring nodes in order of their depth from the root, like what BFS does, UCS expands nodes in order of their cost from the root. At each step, the next step n is chosen to be the one that minimizes a cost value g(n). g(n) is defined as the total cost of getting to a node n from the current position. The nodes are stored in a priority queue.\nNow let’s have an example to see how UCS works. Below is the graph we will traverse. Note that now each edge in the graph has its own cost value. We have a table to record the g(n) of each node in the graph and initialize all nodes’ g(n) to ∞ at first. We also have a priority queue PQ that records the nodes UCS will explore. Suppose the source node is node a. Just like BFS, we will explore the children of a node, push them into our priority queue PQ, and then pop the node out of PQ. We will decide which node to explore next based on which element in our queue has the smallest g(n) value. To facilitate this, we put nodes into PQ in ascending order of associated cost.

It does this by gradually increasing the limit—first 0, then 1, then 2, and so on—until a goal is found. This will occur when the depth limit reaches d, the depth of the shallowest goal node.\nLet’s use the DFS example again to see how IDS works:\nBelow is the graph we will traverse. Same as DFS, we use the stack data structure S2 to record the node we’ve explored. Suppose the source node is node a. Assume also that the ‘solution’ node is node g.\n\nS2:\nAt first, the depth limit L = 0.\nThere is only the node a reachable.

Pop a from S2.\n\nS2:\nS2 is empty now.

As usual, let’s first assume the given graph is a tree and:\n\nBranching factor is B\nThe depth of the solution is D\nThe maximum depth of the tree is Dm\n\nIf the graph is finite in space, then IDS is complete. IDS is also optimal when the edge costs are the same since it will find the solution that is the ‘closest’ to the root just like what BFS does. The time complexity of IDS is $$O(B^D)$$ since IDS will be stopped when find the shallowest solution node. The space complexity of IDS is $$O(BD)$$ which is linear because it only needs to record the route it currently searching on. So, Iterative deepening combines the benefits of depth-first and breadth-first search. Like depth-first search, its memory requirements are modest: $$O(BD)$$ to be precise. Like breadth-first search, it is complete when the branching factor is finite and optimal when the path cost is a non-decreasing function of the depth of the node.\n"},"what-is-bidirectional-search.html":{"url":"what-is-bidirectional-search.html","title":"What is bidirectional search","keywords":"","body":"What is bidirectional search?\nAs mentioned before, bidirectional search runs two simultaneous searches: one forward from the initial state, and one backward from the goal, stopping when the two meet in the middle. All the search algorithms we have introduced so far search in one direction which start from root and end at the goal. However, in bidirectional search, we need to handle not only letting the algorithm search from root to goal but also searching from the goal back to root. This special part requires a method for computing current node’s predecessor. \nFor example, given a graph, the program should have a way to ‘imagine’ what it looks like before being finished. Also, in reality, we usually have just one problem but many solutions. In order to make bidirectional search work, we have to know how to gather all those solutions together to be one goal node.\n\nHere is a schematic view of a bidirectional search\n"},"the-property-of-bidirectional-search.html":{"url":"the-property-of-bidirectional-search.html","title":"The property of bidirectional search","keywords":"","body":"Properties of bidirectional search\nImplementing a bidirectional search is not an easy job. Bidirectional search has some major advantages that make it worth it. Let’s assume we’re using BFS for both the forward and backward searches in the bidirectional search.
