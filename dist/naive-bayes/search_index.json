It is favored by beginners for its simplicity, but it has it’s place in more advanced projects, and is essential to big data applications. The NBC requires an understanding of statistics and probability to understand, but it is not based on geometric properties of feature space, and does not explicitly involves a decision boundary. The NBC is a strong solution to classification problems that assumes independence between features, and is extremely useful in applications where that assumption is likely to be true.\nIn simple terms, a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is independent of the presence of any other feature. For example, consider the case of classifying fruit. A fruit may be an apple if it is red, round, and about 3 inches in diameter. We might also find that, in general, red fruits are very likely to be round. This fact should, intuitively, affect our final probability estimate for deciding the type of some new fruit. However, the naive assumption of the NBC makes that sort of fact unusable in our calculations. This isn’t meant to weaken the algorithm, it’s meant to make inferring a probability much more efficient when the number of features we have is huge.\n"},"how-it-works.html":{"url":"how-it-works.html","title":"How it works?","keywords":"","body":"How it works?\nHere we have the generic form of Bayes theorem\nP(C|x) = \\frac{P(x|C)P(C)}{P(x)}\nLet x be a vector composed of N elements, corresponding to N features in a dataset. For any new point, Bayes theorem allows us to calculate the probability of a certain class, P(C|x), given P(C), P(x), and P(x|C). Technically, these four terms are called the posterior, prior, evidence, and likelihood, respectively. Typically the likelihood, P(x|C), is expressed as a joint probability, as in\nP(C|x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},x_{4},...,x_{n}) = \\frac{P(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},x_{4},...,x_{n}|C)P(C)}{P(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},x_{4},...,x_{n})}\nHowever, because of our naive assumption, this term is replaced with a product of probabilities,\nP(C|x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},x_{4},...,x_{n}) = \\frac{P(x_{1}|C)P(x_{2}|C)P(x_{3}|C)P(x_{4}|C)...P(x_{n}|C)P(C)}{P(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},x_{4},...,x_{n})}\nThe evidence, P(x), is a term that we can omit, as it is a normalization constant that does not change the outcome of our classifier. P(C) is the prior probability of our class, or more specifically, the percentage of training examples that are of class C. Taking these together, we come to the following expression to calculate the probability of a class given a datapoint.\nP(C|x) = P(x_{1}|C)P(x_{2}|C)P(x_{3}|C)P(x_{4}|C)...P(x_{n}|C)P(C)\nThe NBC classifier computes this term for every class, and the classification rule is to return the class that maximizes this probability. The naive Bayes classifier is a MAP, or maximum a posteriori, based method, in that the classifier returns the class with the highest likelihood probability.\n"},"likelihood-inference.html":{"url":"likelihood-inference.html","title":"Likelihood Inference","keywords":"","body":"Likelihood Inference\nAs we’ve seen, the NBC involves the use of the conditional probability of a testing point given a class. At classification time, every conditional probability, given every class, is used for classification. These conditional probabilities may be extracted from the training set and stored for classification time. Alternatively, they may be calculated at classification time based on some parameters. This choice depends on the type of features being used. If the features are binary or counts, or in general, marking occurrences of some event, then we may directly store the conditional probabilities of those features.\nAlternatively, and necessarily for ordinal features, we can fit a distribution over each feature, for each class. We can store the parameters for these distributions, and with them calculate the likelihoods, rather than storing the direct probabilities. This is called storing densities.\n\n\n\nClass/Word\nNigerian\nPrince\ncollateral\nCNN\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nSpam\n400\n600\n400\n20\n1420\n\n\nNot Spam\n80\n40\n120\n1000\n1240\n\n\n\nHere we see an example of a simplified dataset. Because the events we are modelling as features are counts, we can store the probabilities directly.\nFor example, the probability of an email that contains the words ‘CNN’ and ‘Prince’ would be classified as follows\nP(spam|prince, CNN) \\approx P(prince|spam)P(CNN|spam)P(spam) = \\frac{600}{1420}\\frac{20}{1420}\\frac{1420}{2660} = .97\nP(nonspam|prince, CNN) \\approx P(prince|nonspam)P(CNN|nonspam)P(nonspam) = \\frac{40}{1240}\\frac{1000}{1240}\\frac{1240}{2660} = 1.3\nThus, our classifier decides that such an email is not spam.\nStoring densities is essential if the features of our space are measurements, as opposed to counts. Consider the example problem of classifying different species of fish based on length, weight, color, etc. You can’t reliably ‘count’ the occurrences of these features per class, but you can take them as features with a corresponding distribution. The user has a choice of distribution to use for density storage, but typically the normal distribution is used.\nA fuller, more formal treatment can be found below.\n"},"pros-and-cons.html":{"url":"pros-and-cons.html","title":"Pros and Cons","keywords":"","body":"Pros and Cons\nPros\n\nNBC is easy and fast to make predictions\nNBC performs well in multiclass prediction.\nWhen the independence assumptions holds, a Naive Bayes classifier performs extremely efficiently, that is, it needs very little data to achieve high accuracy.\nIt performs well in case of categorical input variables compared to numerical variable(s). For numerical variable, a distribution must be assumed (which is a strong assumption).\n\nCons\n\nIf the test data set contains a category which was not observed in the training data set, then the model will assign a 0 (zero) probability and will be unable to make a prediction. This is often known as “Zero Frequency”. To solve this, we can use a smoothing technique. One of the simplest smoothing techniques is called Laplace estimation.\nIn real life, it is almost impossible that we get a set of features which are completely independent.\n\n"},"the-formal-naive-bayes-model.html":{"url":"the-formal-naive-bayes-model.html","title":"The Formal Naive Bayes Model","keywords":"","body":"The Formal Naive Bayes Model\n\nNaive Bayes methods are a set of supervised learning algorithms based on applying Bayes’ theorem with the “naive” assumption of independence between every pair of features.

The prior, P(y), is just the percentage of training examples that were of class y.\n"},"a-concrete-example.html":{"url":"a-concrete-example.html","title":"A Concrete Example","keywords":"","body":"A Concrete Example\nTo demonstrate the concept of naïve Bayes classification, consider the example displayed in the illustration above. As indicated, the points can be classified as either G for green, or R for red. Our task is to classify new cases based on the statistics of this set.\nSince there are twice as many G points as R, it is reasonable to believe that a new case (which hasn't been observed yet) is twice as likely to be green rather than red. In a Bayesian analysis, this is expressed by the prior probability.\nThus, we can write:\nPrior\\quad probability\\quad for\\quad GREEN \\propto \\frac{Number\\quad of\\quad GREEN\\quad objects}{Total\\quad number\\quad of\\quad objects}\nPrior\\quad probability\\quad for\\quad RED \\propto \\frac{Number\\quad of\\quad RED\\quad objects}{Total\\quad number\\quad of\\quad objects}\nSince there is a total of 60 objects, 40 of which are GREEN and 20 RED, our prior probabilities for class membership are:\nPrior\\quad probability\\quad for\\quad GREEN \\propto \\frac{40}{60}\nPrior\\quad probability\\quad for\\quad RED \\propto \\frac{20}{60}\n\nHaving formulated our prior probability, we are now ready to classify a new object (the white circle). Since the objects are well clustered, it is reasonable to assume that the more G (or R) objects in the vicinity of X, the more likely that the new cases belong to that particular color. For this case, we will model the likelihood with a KNN-like probability measure. To measure this likelihood, we draw a circle around X which encompasses a user chosen number of points. Then we calculate percentage of these points in each class label. From this we calculate the likelihood:\nLikelihood\\,of\\,X\\,given\\,GREEN\\propto \\frac{Number\\,of\\,GREEN\\, in \\,the\\, vicinity\\, of\\,X}{Total\\,number\\,in\\,the\\,vicinity\\,of\\,X}\nLikelihood\\,of\\,X\\,given\\,RED \\propto \\frac{Number\\,of\\,RED\\, in \\,the\\, vicinity\\, of\\,X}{Total\\,number\\,in\\,the\\,vicinity\\,of\\,X}\nFrom the illustration above, it is clear that Likelihood of X given GREEN is smaller than Likelihood of X given RED, since the circle encompasses 1 GREEN object and 3 RED ones. Thus:\nLikelihood\\quad of\\quad X\\quad given\\quad GREEN = \\frac{1}{4}\nLikelihood\\quad of\\quad X\\quad given\\quad RED = \\frac{3}{4}\nAlthough the prior probabilities suggest that X may belong to GREEN the likelihoods suggest otherwise. Bayes theorem allows us to weight both of these together. The final classification is given by:\nPosterior\\quad of\\quad RED\\quad given\\quad X = \\frac{3}{4} * \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{4}\nPosterior\\quad of\\quad GREEN\\quad given\\quad X = \\frac{1}{4} * \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{6}\nFinally, we classify X as RED since it has the larger posterior given X.\n"},"extensions.html":{"url":"extensions.html","title":"Extensions","keywords":"","body":"Extensions\nThis section covers a famous distribution that we can fit to generate likelihoods, as in the density storage method described above:\n\nThe Gaussian, or normal distribution can be used in classification and it assumes that features follow a normal distribution.\nIn this case, the likelihood of the features is assumed to be Gaussian:\nP(x_{i}|y) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma _{y}}}exp(-\\frac{(x_{i}-y_{i})^{2}}{2\\sigma _{y}^{2}})\nThe parameters \\sigma _{y} and \\mu _{y} are taken from the training data points within class y at training time.
