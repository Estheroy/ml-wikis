## What is Probability
Generally, probability is the study of the chances of events occurring. In mathematics, probability is the **measure of the chance that  particular event(s) will occur**, expressed on a linear scale from **$$0$$ (impossible)** to **$$1$$ (certain)**.

There are two major interpretations for probability theory: the perspective of objectivists and subjectivists. Probabilities can be seen as describing tendencies in repeated trials The notion of probabilities as an approximation to long-run frequencies make good sense in a context of repeated trials. However, it does not always make sense to think in terms of repeated trials if we are interested in the events that can only occur once.

* Frequency View 

The probability of an event A is the expected or estimated relative frequency of A in a large number of trails. The proportion of the number of event A occurs in n trials is expected to be roughly equal to the theoretical probability $$P(A)$$ if n is large.

$$ùëÉùëõ(ùê¥) ‚Üí ùëÉ(ùê¥)$$  for large n.

For example, if we are rolling one dice for $$6000$$ times, the dice shows $$4$$ happens $$1000$$ times out of 6000 trails. Thus, the relative probability of the event that the dice shows $$4$$ is $$\frac{1000}{6000} = \frac{1}{6}$$ from the perspective of objectivists.
      

* Opinion View                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
	
The opinion view, sometimes called the **Bayesian view**, arose in response to the many cases where relative frequency does not make much sense. In this view probability statements ultimately reduce to some kind of **initiative judgement of the uncertainties** involved. Such judgements are also be called **probabilistic opinion** or **degrees of belief** since they mostly rely on subjective opinion and only contain superficial objective quality.
	
For example, if you are the patient considering an operation, you want the doctor to tell you what he thinks your chances are. Since the notion of repeated operations make no sense and the state of health varies from person to person, it is difficult for the doctor to know survival percentages for you. Also different doctors might have different opinions and then somehow you form your own opinion as to your chances. The probabilistic opinion in this case is often necessary although imprecise.
