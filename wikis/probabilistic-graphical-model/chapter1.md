## What is Probabilistic Graphical Model

The Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) is a probabilistic model that encodes conditional dependences of the distribution in the topology (aka connectivity) of the graph. Typical examples of PGMs are Bayesian Networks and Markov Models. This approach outlines the structure that the events in the distribution exhibit, providing us with more tools to analyze the probabilities and to decrease the time of computation. These kinds of models are commonly used in the fields of probability, statistics and machine learning.
