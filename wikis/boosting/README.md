## Abstract

Boosting is a method for combining multiple classifiers to improve the accuracy. We explain the general approach, the most popular algorithm, adaboost, and other approaches to boosting.

It's a multi-part series in which I am planning to cover the following:

1. What is Boosting?
2. Weak Learning
3. Adaboost
4. Other Boosting Algorithms
5. Boosting Applications
6. Why Boosting Works?
