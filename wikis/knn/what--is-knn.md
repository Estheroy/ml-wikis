## What is KNN?

KNN is a non-parametric supervised classifier. KNN can also be used for metric learning and density estimation. KNN is simple, and does not have a true _training phase_, which sets it apart from most other classifiers. KNN is extremely dependent on well chosen _features_. Despite its simplicity, KNN is an extremely common and effective classifier. We will cover theory, especially choice of hyper-parameters, implementation, and extensions into metric learning.
