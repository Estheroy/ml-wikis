# KNN

K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is a **non-parametric supervised classifier**. Although it is among the simplest of all machine learning algorithms, it achieves great efficiency in a lot of classification problems and generally considered as the baseline for benchmarking other more complex algorithms.

It's a multi-part series in which I am planning to cover the following:

1. What is KNN?
2. Theory and Terms
3. Choosing K as a hyper-parameter
4. Simple Extensions
5. The Applications of KNN
