## Simple Extensions

KNN can be used in a **regression** setting, where, instead of returning the mode class of the neighbors, the regressor returns the average of the neighborâ€™s target values.

KNN can also be weighed by the relative distance of the neighbors. This is the so called **weighted KNN**.
