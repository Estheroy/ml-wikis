# Opportunities and Applications

Due to the iterative nature of deep learning algorithms, their complexity as the number of layers increase, and the large volumes of data needed to train the networks, a lot of computational power is needed to solve deep learning problems.

**Traditional modeling methods** are well understood, and their predictive methods and business rules can be explained. Deep learning methods have been characterized as more of a black-box approach. You can prove that they perform well by testing them on new data. However, it is difficult to explain to decision makers why they produce a particular outcome, due to their nonlinear nature. This can create some resistance to adoption of these techniques, especially in highly regulated industries.

On the other hand, **the dynamic nature of learning methods** – their ability to continuously improve and adapt to changes in the underlying information pattern – presents a great opportunity to introduce less deterministic, more dynamic behavior into analytics. Greater personalization of customer analytics is one possibility.

Another great opportunity is to improve accuracy and performance in applications where neural networks have been used for a long time. Through better algorithms and more computing power, we can add greater depth.
