# Deep Learning

Deep learning trains a computer to perform human-like tasks, such as recognizing speech, identifying images or making predictions. Instead of organizing data to run through predefined equations, deep learning sets up basic parameters about the data and trains the computer to learn on its own by recognizing patterns using many layers of processing.

In this section, we will talk about: 

* Why is deep learning important today?

* Deep Learning opportunities and applications?

* How is deep learning being used?

* How does deep learning work?
