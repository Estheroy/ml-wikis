# Why is deep learning important today

Deep learning is one of the foundations of cognitive computing. The current interest in deep learning is due in part to the buzz surrounding cognitive computing, software applications that understand human input and can respond in humanlike form or output. Deep learning techniques have greatly improved our ability to classify, recognize, detect and describe â€“ in one word, understand. Many applications are in fields where these tasks apply to non-numerical data, for example, classification of images, recognizing speech, detecting objects and describing content. Systems such as Siri and Cortana are powered in part by cognitive computing and driven by deep machine learning.

Several developments are now advancing deep learning. Algorithmic improvements have boosted the performance of deep learning methods, and improving the accuracy of machine learning approaches creates massive business value. New classes of neural networks have been developed that fit particularly well for applications like text translation and image classification. Neural networks have existed for almost 50 years. They had fallen out of favor by the late 1990s due to difficulties in getting good accuracy in the absence of large training data. However, two changes within the last decade have revolutionized their use:

1. We have a lot more data available to build neural networks with many deep layers, including streaming data from the Internet of Things, textual data from social media, physician's notes and investigative transcripts.

2. Computational advances of distributed cloud computing and graphics processing units have put incredible computing power at our disposal. This level of computing power is necessary to train deep algorithms.

At the same time, human-to-machine interfaces have evolved greatly as well. The mouse and the keyboard are being replaced with gesture, swipe, touch and natural language, ushering in a renewed interest in cognitive computing.
