## Abstract

The theory of bayesian statistics, named for Thomas Bayes, is a one of a number of interpretations of probability. With Bayes’ rule we are solving the “inverse probability problem”, that is we are going from the effect (the data) back to the cause (the parameter)

Here, we are going to learn about bayesian statistics from the very basic concepts in conditional probability to modern application of bayesian methods.
