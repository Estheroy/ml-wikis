## LSTM

Long Short Term Memory networks – usually just called “LSTMs” – are a special kind of RNN, capable of learning long-term dependencies. 
They were introduced by [Hochreiter & Schmidhuber \(1997\)](http://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/pdfs/Hochreiter97_lstm.pdf) ,and were refined and popularized by many people in following [work](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/#fn1). They work tremendously well on a large variety of problems, and are now widely used.

It's a multi-part series in which I am planning to cover the following:

1. What is LSTM?
2. The core idea behind LSTM
3. Step by Step LSTM walk through
4. Variants on Long Short Term Memory
5. GRU VS LSTM
