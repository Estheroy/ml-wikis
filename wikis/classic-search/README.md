## Abstract

In Artificial Intelligence, the graph search algorithms are widely used for problems such as finding the shortest path in a graph and searching for the best strategy.

It's a multi-part series in which I am planning to cover the following:

1. What is graph search algorithm
2. Graphs and Trees
3. Branching Factor
4. Complete and Optimal
5. What is breadth-first search
6. The property of breadth-first search
7. What is depth-first search
8. The property of depth-first search
9. What is uniform-cost search
10. The property of uniform-cost search
11. What is depth-limited search
12. The property of uniform-cost search
13. What is iterative deepening search
14. The property of iterative deepening search
15. What is bidirectional search
16. The property of bidirectional search
