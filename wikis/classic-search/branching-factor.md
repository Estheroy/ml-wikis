## Branching Factor

In tree data structures the branching factor is the average number of children at each node. If the branching factor is 10, then there will be 10 nodes one level down from the current position, 102 (or 100) nodes two levels down, 103 (or 1000) nodes three levels down, and so on. The higher the branching factor, the more rapidly it grows down successive levels.
