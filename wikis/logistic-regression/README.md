## Abstract

Logistic regression is a method used in classification problems, usually employed as the last layer mapping output to a probability distribution. To be more specific, the logistic regression method is a binary classifier that is often used at the prediction step of a more complicated neural network.

It's a multi-part series in which I am planning to cover the following:

1. What is Logistic Regression and Softmax?
2. Uses and Advantages
3. Sigmoid function
4. Weights and Prediction
5. Cost function
6. Gradient Computation 
7. Training
