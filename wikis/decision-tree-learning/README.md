## Abstract

We introduce the theory and usage of decision trees. We cover motivating concepts of the method, including the nature of the tree structure, as well as a methods of prediction using learned trees. We then introduce the Iterative Dichotomiser 3 (ID3) decision tree learning algorithm, and show how it applies to a nominal data example. We then move into the C45 algorithm, an extension of the ID3 algorithm, and demonstrate it as applied to a continuous data problem. We conclude with the issue of overfitting in decision trees and introduce the pruning technique included in the C4.5 algorithm to address this issue.

It's a multi-part series in which I am planning to cover the following:

1. Introduction to Decision Trees
2. General Usage and Theory
3. The ID3 and C4.5 Learning Algorithms
