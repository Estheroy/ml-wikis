# What is Regression?

Regression are fundamental supervised learning methods. It has two categories: linear regression and polynomial regression. The central goal of **linear regression** is to fit a linear surface to some data. The term ‘linear surface’ refers to a line in two dimensions, a plane in three, and a hyperplane in any more. **Polynomial regression** is similar, except that the surface it fits to data is not necessarily linear. Both methods are parametric, and training involves minimizing an error function over a set of internal parameters. 

Before heading into these methods, you should review the concept of supervised learning. Then we’ll move into **theory and usage** of linear regression. Finally, we will move to the **model choices** and **cost function** of the linear regression. Then we will finish off with the overview of **polynomial regression**.
