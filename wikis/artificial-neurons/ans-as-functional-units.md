## ANs as Functional Units

AN methods typically can’t accomplish much as a single classifier. Methods based on AN models can only achieve high performance with some innovative training method. The most famous example of this is SVM, which is based on a **sign-activation AN**. Logistic regression is another famous example of a single neuron method, which is a very simple and elegant solution for appropriate problems, but which cannot hope to accomplish much for ambitious machine learning problems.

The point of formulating artificial neurons as such, as opposed to just thinking of them as a loose set of related function, is to introduce in functional, as opposed to theoretical, terms a class of functions that form the basis for neural networks and deep learning methods.

Artificial neurons motivate the concept of the neural networks. One can now make sense of the most powerful learning algorithms in the world as a set of artificial neurons, and all that’s left to be understood is the way they are connected. We urge the reader to see our neural networks and SVM wikis for a full understanding of AN based methods.
