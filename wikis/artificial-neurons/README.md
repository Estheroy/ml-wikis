## Abstract

This article introduces the notion of artificial neurons, which are the general case of linear classifiers and similar models. The article focuses on understanding the commonalities of artificial neurons, including the use of a transfer and activation function. It gives equal treatment to different activation functions, teaching users how to understand and interpret their workings and use. 



It's a multi-part series in which I am planning to cover the following:

1. What are Artificial Neurons
2. Weights and Weighting steps
3. Activation Functions
4. ANs as functional units
