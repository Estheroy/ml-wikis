# Machine Learning

Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. Using algorithms that iteratively learn from data, machine learning allows computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed where to look. To get the most value from machine learning, you have to know how to pair the best algorithms with the right tools and processes. 

In this section, we will talk about: 

* The evolution of machine learning?

* Why Machine Learning is so important?

* Who is using Machine Learning?

* What are some popular machine learning methods?

* What are the differences between data mining, machine learning and deep learning?
