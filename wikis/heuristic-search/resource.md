## Evaluation Function

**Heuristic search algorithms** also employ an **evaluation function** to help decide which nodes to explore first. Usually **heuristic search algorithms** will explore nodes in ascending order of associated value of evaluation function. The algorithms vary primarily across the choice of evaluation function. It tend to inform **evaluation functions**, in fact, the latter is usually a logical implementation of the former.
