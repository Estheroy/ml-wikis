## Abstract

Artificial Intelligence involves massive search of the solutions. So, search algorithms are important in Artificial Intelligence. Previously, we have already introduced many **classic search algorithms**. (You can view the topic here) Now we will dig deeper on more advanced and efficient search algorithms.

It's a multi-part series in which I am planning to cover the following:

1. What is Heuristic Search?
2. Heuristic Function
3. Evaluation Function
4. Admissible
5. What is Greedy Best-first Search?
6. Property of greedy best-first Search
7. What is A-search?
8. Property of A-search
