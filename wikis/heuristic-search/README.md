## Abstract

Artificial Intelligence involves massive search of the solutions. So, search algorithms are important in Artificial Intelligence. Previously, we have already introduced many classic search algorithms. (You can view the topic here) Now we will dig deeper on more advanced and efficient search algorithms.

The following sections will introduce you the idea of informed (heuristic) search:

1. What is informed (heuristic) search
2. Heuristic function
3. Admissible
4. What is greedy best-first search
5. Property of greedy best-first search
6. What is A-search
7. Property of A-search
