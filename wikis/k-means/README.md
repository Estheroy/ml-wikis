# K-Means

K-means is one of the simplest unsupervised learning algorithms that solve the well known clustering problem. Its goal is to cluster N data points into K disjoint subsets Sj each containing Nj data points so as to minimize the average squared Euclidean distance.


It's a multi-part series in which I am planning to cover the following:

1. What is k-means?
2. Usage
3. Theory and Algorithm
4. Weaknesses and Fixes of K-Means
