## Usage

Clustering algorithms like K-means are good for many tasks in the data-driven world. A major high-tech example is market segmentation. Amazon probably wants to group customers into different market segments in order to recommend appropriate products to them, based on implicit preferences gathered from data.

Facebook uses clustering algorithms to generate a “smart list” for you, so you can find coworkers, classmates and local friends with the same interests.

There are many other applications of clustering algorithms. At heart, they all serve to identify **commonalities** in subsets of the data.
