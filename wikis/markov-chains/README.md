## Abstract

The Markov Chain is a probabilistic graphical model with a Markov Property, which is used to analyze random processes. This model has applications in machine learning, physics and economics. In this article provide an overview of discrete-time Markov chains.

It's a multi-part series in which I am planning to cover the following:

1. What is Markov Chain
2. Discrete-time Markov Chain
