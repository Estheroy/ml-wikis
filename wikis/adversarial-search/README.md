## Abstract

In artificial intelligence area, game playing is a popular topic. Due to the special properties of game playing such as limit time and multiplayer, computer scientists needs to find an high efficient and reliable search algorithm that can help computer to figure out the best strategy.

It's a multi-part series in which I am planning to cover the following:

1. What is adversarial search?
2. Deterministic Games
3. Back Tracking
4. Minimax algorithm
5. Alpha-beta Pruning Algorithm
