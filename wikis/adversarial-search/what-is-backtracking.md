## What is backtracking?

Backtracking is a general strategy for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems. In graph search, when the program reaches a node and decides the current route won’t lead to the desired solution, it will ‘abandon’ all the nodes on this route and go back to the last starting point. This process is called backtracking.
