## Abstract

In machine learning, the **perceptron** is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers, which is a class of functions that can decide whether an input, represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class or not.

The following sections is constructed as following:

* What is perceptron?
* Inspiration of perceptron
* Perceptron architecture
* Perceptron Learning Algorithm
* Convergence and Limitation
