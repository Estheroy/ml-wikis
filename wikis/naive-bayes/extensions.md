This section covers a famous distribution that we can fit to generate likelihoods, as in the density storage method described above:

The **Gaussian**, or normal distribution can be used in classification and it assumes that features follow a normal distribution.

In this case, the likelihood of the features is assumed to be Gaussian:

$$P(x_{i}|y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma _{y}}}exp(-\frac{(x_{i}-y_{i})^{2}}{2\sigma _{y}^{2}})$$

The parameters $$\sigma _{y}$$ and $$\mu _{y}$$ are taken from the training data points within class y at training time. Note that a pair of mu and sigma must be taken _for every feature, for every class_. This means that we store 2Dy parameters for estimation. The above function is applied to every feature, using that feature and classâ€™ parameters, to infer the likelihood for that point. Classification can proceed as in the above.
