# Naive Bayes

The Naive Bayesian classifier, or NBC, is a **multi-class parametric classifier** that uses explicit statistics of a training set to classify points. The NBC is extremely effective, yet simple both in memory and computationally, and is often used on large datasets. Here we cover theory, implementation, and advantages, disadvantages of the NBC.
