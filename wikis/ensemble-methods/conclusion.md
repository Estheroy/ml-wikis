## Conclusion

Ensemble methods are a simple way to improve classifier performance by combining multiple different classifiers with a majority vote. Bagging uses resampling with replacement to create many different training datasets, called bags, which are then each used to train a classifier. The voted average of all the classifiers is the prediction of the bagged classifier.
