## Abstract

In this wiki, we cover ensemble methods, a way of combining multiple machine learning methods to improve our accuracy. We cover the general case of ensemble methods, and a particular example, bagging. We then cover random forests, an application of ensemble methods to decision trees. 

It's a multi-part series in which I am planning to cover the following:

1. What are Ensemble Methods
2. Bagging
3. Random Forests
4. Conclusion
