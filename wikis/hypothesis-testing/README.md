## Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing is used to provide information to reject or accept claims about popluation distribution by examining a sample that population. Hypothesis testing is categorized as parametric test and nonparametric test. The parametric test includes $$z-test$$, $$t-test$$, $$F-test$$ and $$x^2-test$$. The nonparametric test includes sign test, Wilcoxon Rank-sum test, Kruskal-Wallis test and permutation test.

Hypothesis testing is widely used in medicine, dentistry, health care, biology and other fields as a means to draw conclusions about the nature of populations. Application of hypothesis testing will allow manufactures and scientists to better understand quality data and provide guidance to production and experiment control.
