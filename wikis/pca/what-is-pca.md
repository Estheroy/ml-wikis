# What is PCA?

Principal Components Analysis \(PCA\) is a simple algorithm often used for data analysis, and is most often used for dimensionality reduction. Typically, PCA is used as a pre-processing step for many larger methods of analysis. It has numerous applications besides dimensionality reduction, including data compression and visualization. It is also a core method for many more powerful extensions. Besides applications, we cover theory, implementation, and use of the PCA method.

Raw data collected from the real world can be very _noisy_ or extraneous. PCA is a powerful technique, rooted in _Linear Algebra_, that addresses this problem. At heart, it is a method of determining the most and least important directions of a dataset, using the dataâ€™s intrinsic statistics. Such a determination will allow for intelligent manipulation of the data. The data can then be reduced in dimensionality, which yields a more efficient representation. Alternatively, the data can then be denoised, which reduces the complexity of the data, but preserves its original dimensionality.
