# What is PCA?

Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is a simple algorithm often used for data analysis. Raw data collected from the real world can be very noisy or extraneous. PCA is a technique rooted in linear algebra that addresses this problem. At heart, it is a method of determining the directions of greatest importance in a dataset, using the dataâ€™s intrinsic statistics. PCA is most often used for **dimensionality reduction**, though it is commonly seen in **data compression** and **visualization**.
