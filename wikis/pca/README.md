# PCA

Principal Components Analysis \(PCA\) is a simple algorithm often used for data analysis, and is most often used for dimensionality reduction. Typically, PCA is used as a pre-processing step for many larger methods of analysis. It has numerous applications besides dimensionality reduction, including data compression and visualization. It is also a core method for many more powerful extensions. Besides applications, we cover theory, implementation, and use of the PCA method.
