## Abstract

A Bayesian network reflects the states of some part of a world that is being modeled and it describes how those states are related by probabilities. The model might be of your house, or your car, your body, your community, an ecosystem, a stock-market, etc. Absolutely anything can be modeled by a Bayes net.
