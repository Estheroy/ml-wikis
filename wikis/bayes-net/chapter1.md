## What is a Bayes net (belief network)

Having presented both theoretical and practical reasons for artificial intelligence to use probabilistic reasoning, we now introduce the key computer technology for dealing with probabilities in AI, namely Bayesian networks. First we will look at the **idea of Bayes net**, see how Bayes net (BNs) are graphical models for reasoning under uncertainty. In addition, BNs model the quantitative strength of the connections between variables, allowing probabilistic beliefs about them to be updated automatically as new information becomes available, we will learn more about these through **a simple example of Bayes net**. Then we will learn the principle behind it - the** Bayes rule**. After these preparation, we will solve a **probabilistic inference using Bayes net** with a concrete example. At the end to wrap up, we will go through the **characteristics of Bayes net.**
