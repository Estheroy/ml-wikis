# Linear Regression

Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm which is often used for classification and prediction problems. It uses a linear combination of variables or function of variables to predict a value of an output variable.

It’s a multi-part series in which I’m planning to cover the following:

1. What is Linear Regression?
2. Supervised Learning
3. The Math Behind Linear Regression
4. Cost Function and Equation Derivation
5. Advantages and Disadvantages
