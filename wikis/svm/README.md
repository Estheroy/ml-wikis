## Abstract
Support vector machines are a class of parametric supervised learning methods that can be used in both classification and regression. SVM can be seen as an extension to perceptrons, using a modified loss function to find a decision boundary that maximizes the gap between classes. SVMs are one of the most efficient algorithms available, and are still competitive with the current cutting edge.


It's a multi-part series in which I am planning to cover the following:

1. What is SVM
2. History of SVM
3. Classic SVM 
4. Key Idea: maximizing the margin
5. Hard Margin for linearly separable data
6. Soft Margin for non-linearly separable data
7. Lagrange Multiplier and Dual Formulation
8. Why Support Vectors
